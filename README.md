# GEO Microarray and RNA-SEQ-Alingment
Pipeline used for Kajitani et al., 2025, "Altered pathways in Cockayne syndrome: Involvement of MAPK, PI3K-Akt, extracellular matrix, inflammation, and neuronal signaling"

Ths article analyzed transcriptome datasets generated using either microarrays or RNA-Seq. Both types of data were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Microarray data was
processed using R, while RNA-Seq data was processed using a pipeline based on Hisat2 alignment followed by read mapping and counting through featureCounts.

The RNA-Seq pipeline is used to obtain data from NCBI SRA (Sequence Read Archive), convert it to a .fastq format, remove adapter sequence and sequences with low quality scores.
Reads are then aligned to a reference genome, generating a .sam file. This file is then converted into a .bam file, used to get the number of raw read counts aligned in each gene.
Read counts table is then read in R and read count numbers are normalized via DESeq2 package, also used to identify differentially expressed genes, along with their respective log2 fold change.
R packages clusterprofiler and enrichplot are then used for enrichment analysis (Over-representation analysis (ORA) and Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and graph plotting.
